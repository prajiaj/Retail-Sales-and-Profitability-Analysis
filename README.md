# üìäRetail-Sales-and-Profitability-Analysis
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow involving data transformation (ETL), data warehousing, and business intelligence reporting using a retail dataset. The focus is on uncovering trends in sales performance, customer behavior, and profit margins over a 4-year period. 

## üß©Key objectives include

  - Identifying top-performing product categories
  - Analyzing regional and segment-level sales
  - Exploring profit margins and discount impacts
  - Creating KPIs and dashboards for decision-making

## üõ† Technologies & Tools Used
  - Alteryx ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) operations including data cleaning, derived metrics, and binning.
  - Snowflake(Data Warehousing, To store and query the transformed data)
  - Power BI(Data Visualization, KPIs)
  - GitHub(Version Control)

# üìäRetail-Sales-and-Profitability-Analysis
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow involving data transformation (ETL), data warehousing, and business intelligence reporting using a retail dataset. The focus is on uncovering trends in sales performance, customer behavior, and profit margins over a 4-year period. 

## üß©Key objectives include:

  - Identifying top-performing product categories
  - Analyzing regional and segment-level sales
  - Exploring profit margins and discount impacts
  - Creating KPIs and dashboards for decision-making

## üõ† Technologies & Tools Used
  - Alteryx ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) operations including data cleaning, derived metrics, and binning.
  - Snowflake(Data Warehousing, To store and query the transformed data)
  - Power BI(Data Visualization,KPIs)
  - GitHub(Version Control)
    
## Project Workflow
**1Ô∏è‚É£Data Source**
  - Dataset: Superstore Sales Data (Superstore_Raw.csv)

  <br>
**ETL in Alteryx**   
 - Cleaned missing/duplicate data
 - Created calculated fields:1Ô∏è‚É£Profit Margin = Profit / Sales 2Ô∏è‚É£Margin Tier: Binned Profit Margin into categories (Low, Medium, High)
 - Formatted numeric fields (e.g., rounded to 2 decimals)
